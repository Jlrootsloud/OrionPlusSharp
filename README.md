Lupus Game Engine
=================

Lupus Engine (Previously known as Orion+#) started as a project to convert Orion+ to c# just to see how fast I could do it.
I succeeded in about 4 days though it was quite unstable. After a lot of work the engine is starting to become stable and useable!
I Have fixed many bugs while also intoducing many new features and improvements!
